    <p>Like most website operators, Codever collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
      browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
      the date and time of each visitor request. Codever's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
      information is to better understand how Codever's visitors use its website. From time to time, Codever
      may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
      usage of its website.</p>
    <p>Codever also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
      for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.codever.dev blog posts. Codever only
      discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Codever discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
      of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
      process it on Codever's behalf or to provide services available at Codever's website, and (ii) that
      have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be

      information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
      support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
      clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Codever takes all measures reasonably
      necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
